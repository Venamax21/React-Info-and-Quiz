            <h1>WHAT IS REACT? </h1>
            <ul>
            <li>React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library.</li> 
            <li>It is used for building User Interfaces in web development.</li> 
            <li>React was first released on May 29, 2013 by Facebook aka Meta.</li> 
            <li>It has since become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building User Interfaces.</li> 
            <li>React follows a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable and independent UI components.</li>
            <li>A component is a small, reusable chunk of code that is often responsible to render some HTML.</li>


            </ul>

            <h1>REACT FEATURES</h1>
            <ul>
            <li>React has many extensions that we can use to create full-fledged UI applications.</li>
            <Li>It supports mobile app development and provides server-side rendering.</Li>
            <li>React divides the web page into multiple components as it's a component-based which means the code is reusable.</li>
            <li>React.js uses JSX which is a combination of HTML and JavaScript. This makes the code easy to debug and easy to understand. </li>
            <li>React uses virtual DOM (Document Object Model) and web application updates are made only the parts that have changed, resulting in faster and more efficient web</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h1>IMPORTANT REACT CONCEPTS </h1>
            <li>JSX</li>
            <li>CONTEXT API</li>
            <li>COMPONENTS</li>
            <li>LIFECYCLE METHODS</li>
            <li>PROP TYPES</li>
            <li>REACT HOOKS</li>
            <li>DESTRUCTURING</li>
            <li>REDUX</li>
            <li>LAZY LOADING</li>
            <li>RENDER PROPS</li>
            <li>VIRTUAL DOM</li>
            <li>REACT LISTS</li>
            <li>FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES?</h1>
            <ul>
            <li>Error Handling - React provides error boundaries to catch and handle errors which prevent the entire UI from crashing.</li>
            <li>Declarative - React is declarative, meaning that you tell React what you want and React will build the actual UI</li>
            <li>One-Way Data Binding - React implements one-way data binding, where changes in the UI instantly trigger updates in the application state. </li>
            <li>Flexibility - React can be integrated with various backend programming languages and is not restricted to a specific task.</li>
            <li>Performance - Its virtual DOM ensures that updates and renders are efficient and fast.</li>
            <li>Virtualization -  React supports Virtualization techniques like windowing virtualization to handle large datasets efficiently.</li>
            </ul>
